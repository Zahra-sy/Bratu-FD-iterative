This project provides a Maple implementation for numerically solving the Bratu problem using an iterative finite difference method (FDM).
The Bratu problem is a nonlinear boundary value problem that arises in various applications such as combustion theory, thermal reaction modeling, and chemical reactionâ€“diffusion systems.
